What is Python, and why is it popular\n","\n","Answer- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language notable for its clarity and ease of use. It is widely adopted due to its readable syntax, comprehensive standard library, strong community support, cross-platform compatibility, and extensive applications in fields such as web development, data analysis, automation, scripting, and education.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python\n","\n","Answer- An interpreter in Python processes code line by line, translating instructions into machine actions at runtime, thereby eliminating the need for a separate compilation step.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n","\n","Answer- Python’s pre-defined keywords—such as if, for, def, class, and import—are reserved for specific syntactic purposes. These keywords cannot be repurposed as variable, function, or class names, as they hold fundamental meaning within the language.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n","\n","Answer- No. Python keywords are reserved and cannot be used as variable/function/class names.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python\n","\n","Answer- Mutability in Python refers to whether an object’s value can be altered after its creation. Mutable objects, such as lists and dictionaries, allow modification of their contents, whereas immutable types—such as integers, floats, tuples, and strings—do not.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n","\n","Answer- The distinction between lists and tuples lies in their mutability. Lists allow changes to their elements and structure, supporting assignments, insertions, and deletions. Conversely, tuples are immutable and maintain a fixed structure, which enables them to be hashable and suitable for use as dictionary keys.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n","\n","Answer- The == operator in Python checks whether two objects have equal values, whereas the is operator determines whether two variables reference the same object in memory.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python\n","\n","Answer- Logical operators in Python—namely and, or, and not—are used to combine or modify Boolean expressions.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python\n","\n","Answer- Type casting involves converting a value from one data type to another, such as using int('5'), float(3), or str(10). Implicit type casting occurs automatically when Python evaluates mixed-type expressions (for example, 1 + 2.0 results in 3.0), while explicit type casting requires the programmer to invoke a conversion function directly.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n","\n","Answer- Implicit: automatic conversion by Python (e.g., 1 + 2.0 → 3.0).\n","\n","Explicit: programmer uses conversion functions (int(), float(), str()) to convert.\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n","\n","Answer- Conditional statements, including if, elif, and else, enable selective execution of code based on evaluated conditions.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work\n","\n","Answer- The elif statement specifically allows for additional condition checks following an initial if statement; the first condition that evaluates as true executes its associated code and subsequent branches are skipped.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n","\n","Answer- For and while loops both facilitate repetition, but differ in usage. For loops iterate over sequences or ranges with a known number of iterations, while while loops continue execution as long as a specified condition remains true, making them more suitable for situations where the number of iterations is undetermined, such as reading input until a certain condition is met.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop\n","\n","Answer- When you don’t know iteration count ahead of time and loop depends on a runtime condition (e.g., reading until end-of-file, repeated input until valid).\n"],"metadata":{"id":"p-LocV9bCE47"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# question 1- Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\"\n","\n","print(\"Hello, World!\")\n","\n","# question 2- Write a Python program that displays your name and age\n","\n","name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n","age = input(\"Enter your age: \")\n","print(f\"Name: {name}\")\n","print(f\"Age: {age}\")\n","\n","# question 3- Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library\n","\n","import keyword\n","print(keyword.kwlist)\n","print(\"Total keywords:\", len(keyword.kwlist))\n","\n","# question 4- Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword.\n","\n","import keyword\n","word = input(\"Enter a word to check if it's a Python keyword: \").strip()\n","if keyword.iskeyword(word):\n","    print(f\"'{word}' is a Python keyword.\")\n","else:\n","    print(f\"'{word}' is NOT a Python keyword.\")\n","\n","# question 5- Create a list and tuple in Python, and demonstrate how attempting to change an element works differently\n","for each\n","\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","\n","print(\"Original list:\", my_list)\n","my_list[0] = 99\n","print(\"Modified list:\", my_list)\n","\n","print(\"Original tuple:\", my_tuple)\n","try:\n","    my_tuple[0] = 99\n","except TypeError as e:\n","    print(\"Cannot modify tuple:\", e)\n","\n","# question 6- Write a function to demonstrate the behavior of mutable and immutable arguments\n","\n","def modify_immutable(x):\n","    print(\"Inside modify_immutable, id before:\", id(x))\n","    x += 5\n","    print(\"Inside modify_immutable, id after:\", id(x))\n","    return x\n","\n","def modify_mutable(lst):\n","    print(\"Inside modify_mutable, id before:\", id(lst))\n","    lst.append(100)\n","    print(\"Inside modify_mutable, id after:\", id(lst))\n","    return lst\n","\n","# Demo\n","a = 10\n","print(\"Before immutable:\", a, id(a))\n","a = modify_immutable(a)\n","print(\"After immutable:\", a, id(a))\n","\n","b = [1,2,3]\n","print(\"Before mutable:\", b, id(b))\n","modify_mutable(b)\n","print(\"After mutable:\", b, id(b))\n","\n","#question 7- Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two user-input numbers\n","\n","a = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n","b = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n","\n","print(\"Addition:\", a + b)\n","print(\"Subtraction:\", a - b)\n","print(\"Multiplication:\", a * b)\n","if b != 0:\n","    print(\"Division:\", a / b)\n","else:\n","    print(\"Division: cannot divide by zero\")\n","print(\"Integer Division (//):\", a // b if b != 0 else \"N/A\")\n","print(\"Modulus:\", a % b if b != 0 else \"N/A\")\n","print(\"Power:\", a ** b)\n","\n","# question 8- Write a program to demonstrate the use of logical operators\n","\n","x = int(input(\"Enter an integer x: \"))\n","print(\"x > 0 and x % 2 == 0 :\", x > 0 and x % 2 == 0)\n","print(\"x > 0 or x % 2 == 0  :\", x > 0 or x % 2 == 0)\n","print(\"not(x > 0)            :\", not (x > 0))\n","\n","# question 9- Write a Python program to convert user input from string to integer, float, and boolean types.\n","\n","s = input(\"Enter a value: \").strip()\n","\n","# To int\n","try:\n","    i = int(s)\n","    print(\"int:\", i)\n","except ValueError:\n","    print(\"Cannot convert to int.\")\n","\n","# To float\n","try:\n","    f = float(s)\n","    print(\"float:\", f)\n","except ValueError:\n","    print(\"Cannot convert to float.\")\n","\n","# To bool: follow Python truthiness for non-empty strings;
